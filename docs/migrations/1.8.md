# Version 1.8 migration guide

## Initialisation
The SmartAds SDK needs to be initialised in an `Application` class in a similar way as with the Analytics SDK. For more details see the [README](../../README.md#initialising).

## Registration and lifecycle callbacks
There is no longer a need to register for ads and to forward lifecycle callbacks as the SDK automatically takes care of these when appropriate.

# Version 1.1 migration guide
This version adds support for the new Engage API introduced in the Analytics SDK and fixes a few bugs.

## Showing ads
Instead of calling `showAd()` or `showRewardedAd()` (or the variants which take a decision point as an argument) in order to show an ad, instances of the `InterstitialAd` or `RewardedAd` class need to be created and shown.

Either class can be instantiated through static `create()` methods which take a varying amount of arguments, and shown by calling `show()`. If an ad is created from an `Engagement` instance then the created instance needs to be null checked, as the decision point may not have been setup for display an ad.

For more details see [here](../../README.md#showing-ads).

# Version 1.7 migration guide

## Dependency repositories
Additional repositories need to be added to the project in order to pull down the necessary dependencies. In the project's `build.gradle` script please make sure that you declare the repositories specified [here](../../README.md#adding-to-a-project).

# Diagnostics
A new module `deltadna-smartads-debug` can now be added to a project in order to show SmartAds diagnostic details. Details on how to add it to a project and how it works can be found [here](../../README.md#diagnostics).
